**What are the risks?** [Key considerations]
```

### **2. Implementation Checklist Template**
```
## Implementation Checklist

**Phase 1: Setup (Day 1)**
- [ ] Environment setup
- [ ] Dependencies installation
- [ ] Configuration files
- [ ] Basic connectivity test

**Phase 2: Core Implementation (Days 2-5)**
- [ ] Component A implementation
- [ ] Component B implementation
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Error handling

**Phase 3: Production Readiness (Days 6-7)**
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security review
- [ ] Monitoring setup
- [ ] Documentation update
```

### **3. Decision Matrix Template**
```
## Technology Decision Matrix

| Requirement | Option A | Option B | Option C | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Performance | High | Medium | Low | Option A |
| Complexity | High | Medium | Low | Option B |
| Cost | High | Medium | Low | Option C |
| Maintenance | High | Medium | Low | Option B |
```

## **Quality Assurance Checklist**

### **Before Finalizing Any Document**
- [ ] **Clarity**: Can a junior developer understand this?
- [ ] **Completeness**: Are all necessary details included?
- [ ] **Actionability**: Can someone implement this immediately?
- [ ] **Consistency**: Does it match the style of other documents?
- [ ] **Accuracy**: Are all technical details correct?
- [ ] **Relevance**: Is the information current and applicable?

### **Developer Experience Validation**
- [ ] Can a developer start implementation within 30 minutes of reading?
- [ ] Are all dependencies and requirements clearly stated?
- [ ] Are there examples for every major concept?
- [ ] Is there a clear path from reading to implementation?
- [ ] Are potential issues and solutions addressed?
