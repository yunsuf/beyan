## **Executive Summary**

This strategic analysis provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming the Kimi-VL Document Digitization System from well-designed documentation into a production-ready, robust multi-agent system. The analysis is grounded in the constraints and best practices outlined in `rule/constrains.md`, emphasizing reliability, human-in-the-loop integration, and iterative refinement.
