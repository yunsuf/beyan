My aim is reading appliying some constrainst written and described in the `rule/constrains.md` file. Read and understand the ideas there so then apply based in description below:
 
Please analyze and examine the existing documentation in the `docs` folder. Based on your analysis:

1. **Read and understand the current  structure** - Identify the main components, architecture, and functionality of the project

3. **Create comprehensive documentation prompts** - Generate specific, actionable prompts that would help complete the documentation, covering:
   - Project overview and purpose
   - Architecture and design decisions
   - API documentation
   - Setup and installation instructions
   - Usage examples and tutorials
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Any missing technical specifications

4. **Generate strategic questions** - Create a comprehensive list of questions about:
   - Project goals and scope
   - Target audience and use cases
   - Technical requirements and constraints
   - Feature priorities and roadmap
   - Integration requirements
   - Performance and scalability considerations
   - Testing and deployment strategies

The goal is to help me understand the current state of the project and provide clear direction for completing  and documentation to make this a production-ready, well-documented project.

Please organize your findings and recommendations in a structured format that will help guide the project's development direction. 
make all questions under @ai-docs with a proper file name.
